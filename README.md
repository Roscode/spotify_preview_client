# Spotify Preview Client
A simple client to search and preview songs using the Spotify Web API. Currently does none of those things, but it does play (and pause) 30 seconds of welcome home by Coheed and Cambria.

## Getting started
The following steps will get the project up and running in development mode on your machine, no other mode exists.

### Prerequisites

You will need node and npm installed, go install them.

### Installing

Clone the repo

    git clone https://github.com/Roscode/spotify_preview_client.git
Install Dependencies

    npm install
Start The Dev Server

    npm start

### Usage

Currently the only thing on the page that does anything is a button that says "play" or "pause" depending on whether the song is paused or playing respectively. Hit that button and the song with pause or play.
